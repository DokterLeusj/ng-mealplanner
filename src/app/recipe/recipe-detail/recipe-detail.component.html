      <div>150g (5oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced</div>
      <div>3 large eggs</div>
      <div>1 cup (about 100g) Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</div>
      <div>1 cup (about 100g) Parmesan cheese, grated</div>
      <div>3 cloves garlic, minced</div>
      <div>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</div>

      <div>Olive oil</div>

      <h3>recipe</h3>
      <p>Boil the Pasta:</p>

      <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
        Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking
        water before draining.</p>

      <p>Prepare the Sauce:</p>

      <p>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese. Set aside.
        Cook the Pancetta (or Guanciale):</p>

      <p>In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat.
        Add the diced pancetta (or guanciale) and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown.
        Add minced garlic to the pan and saut√© for about 1 minute, being careful not to burn it.
        Combine Pasta and Sauce:</p>

      <p>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the
        rendered fat.
        Temper the Eggs:</p>

      <p>Remove the skillet from heat.
        Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing continuously to coat the pasta in the creamy
        sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a smooth and silky sauce.
        Adjust Consistency:</p>

      <p>If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water a little at a time until you reach your
        desired consistency.
        Season and Serve:</p>

      <p>Season the carbonara with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste.
        Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.
        Serve Immediately:</p>

      <p>Carbonara is best served immediately while it's creamy and the pasta is still hot.</p>
